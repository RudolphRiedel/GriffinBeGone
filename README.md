# GriffinBeGone
Addon for World of Warcraft to remove the griffins on the side of the action bar from the default UI.

Copy over the GriffinBeGone folder to your World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns folder.
Activate the addon thru the Game Menu / Addons, reload UI.

Credit for the idea and the name goes to "LiaxX" or "Deathpants-Wildhammer-EU"

After several years of just changing the interface version I had to "rewrite" the two lines of LUA when I tried out the addon in the BfA beta.
And now that the pre-patch of Shadowlands went live I finally decided to make this public.
